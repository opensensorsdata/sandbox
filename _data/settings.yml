Progress happen when social needs drive new applications, and new applications disclose and canalize social hidden potentialities. The business of technology, then, is always socially grounded'}- {image: '004b-1.svg',  title: 'meet the team',  number: '- 2 of 7 -',  content: '**o{s}d team represent a highly diversified approach to social innovation**, gathering together a plurality of expertise from academic, civic and economic field on investigation.       * o{s}d team works by integrating different models of innovation to create and maintain mechanisms that distribute possible technological advances over a network of social needs'}- {image: 'gs08.svg',  title: 'canalizing useful technological response',  number: '- 3 of 7 -',  content: 'Different degree of complexity reveals different possible intervention. Digital possibilities manifest when those interactions are regulated as to provide benefits to the system as a whole.   o{s}d horizontal focus is about experimenting and prototyping these responses. It analyze possible economical and social benefits of interaction between already existing projects, upgrading their use for other purposes or extending their application to a wider range social context in respect to their original goal.   o{s}d vertical focus is about increasing high-level development of raw sensor information. It provides private and public research with the possibility to test, develops and sell complex computational models that require a considerably vast amount of information about our world in order to provides effective prevision of behavior'}- {image: 'image16.svg',  title: 'digital and analog are one and the same natural world',  number: '- 4 of 7 -',  content: 'We want to shape a digital society in which cultural diversity between communities is preserved and commended. We want to build future in which digital and analog are one and the same natural world. So that people and machine can really have the power to shape their social context together. Sensor technology does not provide interpretation out of existing information, it spreads raw ecological information on which new solutions can be built and old issues can be fixed. We don’t provide people with a future, we want the people to have the tools to build their owns'}- {image: '004b-2.svg',  title: 'new artisans linked with new contexts',  number: '- 5 of 7 -',  content: 'o{s}d link artisans to new context of hand-crafting, appraising existing skills by means of new low-cost technological tools. This has two implications.   First, a redevelopment of local business areas across the territory: It enables the use of existing knowledge to improve social use of technology and re-employment opportunities in the context of digital craftsmanship.   Second, it raises awareness about the social significance of technology: people always adopt sensors, including them in everyday experience. They become part of the same natural environment from which they extract information'}- {image: 'gs11.svg',  title: 'knowledge by sensors like civic value',  number: '- 6 of 7 -',  content: 'o{s}d link sensors contribution to its civic value. When the environment is the urban context, sensors can provide crucial information about how to live the city and how to improve its functionality. This has two implications.  First, the smartness of a urban agglomerate is not the amount of technology it has, but how the degree of interactions between its component contribute to the regulation of its behavior.   Second, smart citizens are those who have access to the raw real-time knowledge of the environment in which they live, as to perform better decision-making on complex civic issues, from budget allocation to transport infrastructure'}- {image: 'i_053-6.svg',  title: 'sensors, machine and data for high-skilled researchers',  number: '- 7 of 7 -',  content: 'o{s}d link high-skilled researchers from multiple context of experimentation. National High-Education trains professionals with different range of expertise and domain of influence, e.g. public domain, academic research, private enterprises.   First, public sector can decrease the expense allocation for top-down infrastructures by integrating low-level sensor projects into the public service network. Thus, enabling central services’ cost distribution over already existing ecological solutions.   Second, private enterprise can test the feasibility of new products by analyzing their potential respect to context sensitivity, adjusting global business strategy to local needs. Thus, improving prototype industrialization and sensors market expansion.   Third, academic researchers, both freelance and affiliated ones, can use raw world data to improve predictive models that are highly data demanding, without the need of further funding schemes. Canalizing research activity through prototype applications represents a way to re-use national research investments, effectively applying scalable models’ solution to different target context involved with similar issues. Thus, improving the potential of research application and researchers employments'}#-------------------------------# how Sectionprojects:- {name: Acqualta, folder: 'proj-1', file: 'how/proj-1.html'}- {name: Ardomino, folder: 'proj-2', file: 'how/proj-2.html'}- {name: Open Almanacco, folder: 'proj-3', file: 'how/proj-3.html'}- {name: Smart Agricolture, folder: 'proj-7', file: 'how/proj-7.html'}
